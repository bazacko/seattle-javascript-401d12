=====================================

## Stacks
  * stacks are a data structure that serve as a collection of elements
  * these elements are *stacked* in a last in, first out sequence **aka: (LIFO - last in first out)**
  * **helper:** it may help to think about a stack as a collection of plates and the way that you add and remove them
  * stacks are often used for:
    * history capability with undo functionality
    * call stack management
  * `pop` removes the most recent element from the stack
  * `push` adds a new element to the stack
  * **demo:** implement a stack

## Queues
  * queues are also a data structure that serve as a collection of elements
  * elements in a queue are added in a first in, first out sequence **aka: FIFO - first in first out**
  * **helper:** it may help to think about a queue as a bunch of people standing in line at a concert - the first person in line is the first person in the venue
  * `enqueue` is used to add an element to the end of a queue
  * `dequeue` is used to retrieve and remove an element from the beginning of a queue 
  * **demo:** implement a queue
